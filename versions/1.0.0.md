# Workflows Specification

#### Version 1.0.0

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) [RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Introduction

Being able to express specific sequences of calls and articulate the dependencies between them to achieve a particular goal is desirable in the context of an API definition(s). The aim of the Workflows Specification, is to provide a mechanism that can define sequences of calls and their dependencies to be expressed in the context of delivering a particular outcome or set of outcomes when dealing with API definitions (such as OpenAPI documents).

The Workflows Specification can articulate these workflows in a human and machine readable manner, thus improving the capability of API specifications to tell the story of the API in a manner that can improved the consuming developer experience.

## Definitions

##### Workflows Document
A self-contained or composite resource which defines or describes API workflows (specific sequence of calls to achieve a particular goal in the context of an API definition). The workflows document `MUST` contain a valid Workflows Specification version field, an [Info](#info-object) field, a `sources` field, and there `MUST` be at least one [Procedure](#procedure-object) defined in the procedures fixed field. A Workflows document uses and conforms to the Workflows Specification.

## Specification

### Versions

The Workflows Specification is versioned using a `major`.`minor`.`patch` versioning scheme. The `major`.`minor` portion of the version string (for example 1.0) SHALL designate the Workflows feature set. `.patch` versions address errors in, or provide clarifications to, this document, not the feature set. The patch version SHOULD NOT be considered by tooling, making no distinction between 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 for example.

### Format

A Workflows document that conforms to the Workflows Specification is itself a JSON object, which may be represented either in JSON or YAML format.

All field names in the specification are **case sensitive**.
This includes all fields that are used as keys in a map, except where explicitly noted that keys are **case insensitive**.

In order to preserve the ability to round-trip between YAML and JSON formats, YAML version [1.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) is RECOMMENDED along with some additional constraints:

- Tags MUST be limited to those allowed by the [JSON Schema ruleset](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2803231).
- Keys used in YAML maps MUST be limited to a scalar string, as defined by the [YAML Failsafe schema ruleset](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2802346).

### Document Structure

It is RECOMMENDED that the root Workflows document be named: `workflows.json` or `workflows.yaml`.

### Data Types

Data types in the Workflows Specification are based on the types supported by the [JSON Schema Specification Draft 2020-12](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00#section-4.2.1). Note that integer as a type is also supported and is defined as a JSON number without a fraction or exponent part.

As defined by the JSON Schema Validation vocabulary, data types can have an optional modifier property: `format`. Workflows additionally supports the formats (similar to the OpenAPI specification) to provide fine detail for primitive data types.

The formats defined are:
[`type`](#dataTypes) | [`format`](#dataTypeFormat) | Comments
------ | -------- | --------
`integer` | `int32` | signed 32 bits
`integer` | `int64` | signed 64 bits (a.k.a long)
`number` | `float` | |
`number` | `double` | |
`string` | `password` | A hint to UIs to obscure input.


### Relative References in URLs

Unless specified otherwise, all properties that are URLs MAY be relative references as defined by [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.2).
Unless specified otherwise, relative references are resolved using the URL of the referring document.

### Schema

In the following description, if a field is not explicitly **REQUIRED** or described with a MUST or SHALL, it can be considered OPTIONAL.

#### Workflows Object

This is the root object of the [Workflows document](#workflows-document).

##### Fixed Fields

Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="workflowsVersion"></a>workflows | `string` | **REQUIRED**. This string MUST be the [version number](#versions) of the Workflows Specification that the Workflows document uses. The `workflows` field SHOULD be used by tooling to interpret the Workflows document. 
<a name="workflowsInfo"></a>info | [Info Object](#info-object) | **REQUIRED**. Provides metadata about the Workflows. The metadata MAY be used by tooling as required.
<a name="workflowsSources"></a>sources | Map[`string`, `string`] | **REQUIRED**. An object storing a map between named document keys and location URLs to the source documents (such as an OpenAPI document) this workflow SHALL apply to. Each source location `string` MUST be in the form of a [URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/). MAY be defined using relative references as defined by [RFC3986](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html#bib-RFC3986).
<a name="workflowsProcedures"></a>procedures | Map[`string`, [Procedure Object](#procedure-object)] | **REQUIRED**. A map between a friendly name and a workflow procedure. The map MUST have at least one entry.

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](#specification-extensionsxtensions).

##### Fixed Fields

Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="stepDescription"></a>description | `string` | A description of the step. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation.
<a name="stepId"></a>stepId | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Unique string to represent the step. The id SHOULD be unique amongst all steps described in the workflow. The stepId value is **case-sensitive**. Tools and libraries MAY use the stepId to uniquely identify a procedure step, therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to follow common programming naming conventions.
<a name="stepOperationId"></a>operationId | `string` | The name of an existing, resolvable operation, as defined with a unique `operationId` and existing within one of the `source` documents. The referenced operation will be invoked by this workflow step. If more than one `source` document is defined within a Workflows document, then the `operationId` specified MUST be prefixed with the source name to avoid ambiguity or potential clashes. This field is mutually exclusive of the `operationRef` and `procedureId` fields respectively.
<a name="stepOperationRef"></a>operationRef | `string` | A relative or absolute URI reference to an OAS operation. This field is mutually exclusive of the `operationId` and `procedureId` fields respectively. Relative `operationRef` values MAY be used to locate an existing. See [OpenAPI relative reference resolution rules](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#relativeReferencesURI) for guidance. A complete [URI Template](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6570) can also be used.
<a name="stepProcedureId"></a>procedureId | `string` | The [procedureId](#fixed-fields-2) referencing an existing procedure within the Workflows document. The field is mutually exclusive of the `operationId` and `operationRef` fields respectively.
<a name="stepParameters"></a>parameters | Map[`string`, Any \| {expression}] | A map representing parameters to pass to an operation as specified with `operationId` or identified via `operationRef`. The key is the parameter name to be used, whereas the value can be a constant or an [expression](#runtime-expressions) to be evaluated and passed to the referenced operation or procedure. The parameter name can be qualified using the parameter location [{in}.]{name} for operations that use the same parameter name in different locations (e.g. path.id).
<a name="dependsOn"></a>dependsOn | [`string`] | A list of steps that MUST be completed before this step can be processed. This helps to ensure workflow steps are executed in the correct order and that dependent steps are not processed in parallel. The values provided MUST be the be the `stepId` which uniquely references a step. 
<a name="stepSuccessCriteria"></a>successCriteria | [{expression}] | A list of assertions to determine the success of the step
<a name="stepOnSuccess"></a>onSuccess | [[Success Action](#success-action-object)] | An array of success action objects that specify what to do upon step success. If omitted, the next sequential step shall be executed as the default behavior.
<a name="stepOnFailure"></a>onFailure | [[Failure Action](#failure-action-object)] | An array of failure action objects that specify what to do upon step failure. If omitted, the default behavior is to break and return.
<a name="outputs"></a>outputs | Map[`string`, {expression}] |  A map between a friendly name and a dynamic output value defined using a [runtime expression](#runtime-expressions). The name MUST use keys that match the regular expression: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\.\-_]+$`.  

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](#specification-extensions).

    outputs:
        # outputs from this step
        availablePets: $response.body


```

#### Success Action Object

A single success action which describes an action to take upon success of a procedure step.

##### Fixed Fields
Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="successActionType"></a> type | string | **REQUIRED**. The type of action to take. Possible values are `"end"` or `"goto"`
<a name="successStepId"></a> stepId | string | The `stepId` to jump to based on the success of the step. This field is only relevant when the `type` field value is `goto`. The value of the `stepId` MAY be within any procedure defined in the Workflows document. For convenience, the value MAY be formatted as _procedureId.stepId_.
<a name="successCriteria"></a> criteria | [{expression}] |  A list of assertions to determine if this action SHALL be executed.

**Note -** should multiple success actions have similar successCriteria, the first sequential action matching the criteria SHALL be the action executed.

##### Success Action Object Example
```
type: goto
stepId: joinWaitingListStep
criteria: 
    # assertions to determine if this success action should be executed
    - $response.body.Pets.length() > 0
```

#### Failure Action Object

A single failure action which describes an action to take upon success of a procedure step.

##### Fixed Fields
Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="failureActionType"></a> type | string | **REQUIRED**. The type of action to take. Possible values are `"end"`, `"goto"` or `"retry"`
<a name="failureStepId"></a> stepId | string | The `stepId` to jump to based on the failure of the step. This field is only relevant when the `type` field value is `goto`. The value of the `stepId` MAY be within any procedure defined in the Workflows document. For convenience, the value MAY be formatted as _procedureId.stepId_.
<a name="failureRetryAfter"></a> retryAfter | number | A non-negative decimal indicating the milliseconds delay after the step failure before another attempt SHALL be made. **Note:** if an HTTP [Retry-After](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-retry-after) response header was returned to a step from a targeted operation, then it SHOULD overrule this particular field value. This field only applies when the `type` field value is `retry`.
<a name="failureRetryLimit"></a> retryLimit | integer | A non-negative integer indicating how many attempts to retry the step MAY be attempted before failing the overall step. If not specified then a single retry SHALL be attempted. This field only applies when the `type` field value is `retry`. The `retryLimit` MUST be exhausted prior to executing subsequent failure actions.
<a name="failureCriteria"></a> criteria | [{expression}] |  A list of assertions to determine if this action SHALL be executed.

**Note -** should multiple success actions have similar successCriteria, the first sequential action matching the criteria SHALL be the action executed.

##### Failure Action Object Example
```
type: retry
retryAfter: 1000
retryLimit: 5
criteria: 
    # assertions to determine if this action should be executed
    - $statusCode == 503
```

### <a name="runtimeExpressions"></a>Runtime Expressions
A runtime expression allows values to be defined based on information that will be available within an HTTP message, an event message, and within objects serialized from the Workflows document such as [procedures](#procedure-object) or [steps](#step-object).

The runtime expression is defined by the following [ABNF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234) syntax:

```
      expression = ( "$url" / "$method" / "$statusCode" / "$request." source / "$response." source / "$message." source / "$inputs." name / "$steps." name / "$procedures." name)
      source = ( header-reference / query-reference / path-reference / body-reference / message-header-reference / message-payload-reference )
      header-reference = "header." token
      query-reference = "query." name  
      path-reference = "path." name
      body-reference = "body" ["#" json-pointer ]
      header-reference = "header" ["#" json-pointer]
      payload-reference = "payload" ["#" json-pointer]
      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively
      name = *( CHAR )
      token = 1*tchar
      tchar = "!" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "&" / "'" / "*" / "+" / "-" / "." /
        "^" / "_" / "`" / "|" / "~" / DIGIT / ALPHA
```

##### <a name="runtimeExpressionExamples"></a>Examples

Source Location | example expression  | notes
---|:---|:---|
HTTP Method            | `$method`         | The allowable values for the `$method` will be those for the HTTP operation.
Requested media type | `$request.header.accept`        |  
Request parameter      | `$request.path.id`        | Request parameters MUST be declared in the `parameters` section of the parent operation or they cannot be evaluated. This includes request headers.
Request body property   | `$request.body#/user/uuid`   | In operations which accept payloads, references may be made to portions of the `requestBody` or the entire body.
Request URL            | `$url`            |  
Response value         | `$response.body#/status`       |  In operations which return payloads, references may be made to portions of the response body or the entire body.
Response header        | `$response.header.Server` |  Single header values only are available
Procedure input        | `$inputs.username` |  Single input values only are available
Step output Value        | `$steps.someStep.pets` |  In situations where the output named property return payloads, references may be made to portions of the response body or the entire body.

Runtime expressions preserve the type of the referenced value.
Expressions can be embedded into string values by surrounding the expression with `{}` curly braces.


### <a name="specificationExtensions"></a>Specification Extensions

While the Workflows Specification tries to accommodate most use cases, additional data can be added to extend the specification at certain points.

The extension properties are implemented as patterned fields that are always prefixed by `"x-"`.

Field Pattern | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="workflowsExtensions"></a>^x- | Any | Allows extensions to the Workflows Specification. The field name MUST begin with `x-`, for example, `x-internal-id`. Field names beginning `x-oai-` and `x-oas-` are reserved for uses defined by the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/). The value MAY be `null`, a primitive, an array or an object.

The extensions may or may not be supported by the available tooling, but those may be extended as well to add requested support (if tools are internal or open-sourced).


## <a name="revisionHistory"></a>Appendix A: Revision History

Version   | Date       | Notes
---       | ---        | ---
1.0.0     | TBD        | First release of the Workflows Specification


## <a name="openQuestionsAndIdeas"></a>Appendix B: Open Questions and Ideas

1. What Expression syntax should be used? Initial framing leverages OpenAPI expression syntax as used by Link Object and extend to cover also AsyncAPI needs as well as workflow specific needs.
2. For success criteria, JSON Path or JSON Pointer and/or custom evaluation rules? Should we combine with runtime expressions or handle separately
3. For parameter and request injection, should we create a new `StepMapping` object (inspired by LinkObjects in OAS but more suited to needs)?
