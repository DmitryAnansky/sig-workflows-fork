## Introduction

Being able to express specific sequences of calls and articulate the dependencies between them to achieve a particular goal is desirable in the context of an API definition(s). The aim of the Workflows Specification, is to provide a mechanism that can define sequences of calls and their dependencies to be expressed in the context of delivering a particular outcome or set of outcomes when dealing with APIs definitions (such as OpenAPI documents).

The Workflows Specification can articulate these workflows in a human and machine readable manner, thus improving the capability of API specifications to tell the story of the API in a manner that can improved the consuming developer experience.

## Definitions

##### Workflows Document
A self-contained or composite resource which defines or describes API workflows (specific sequence of calls to achieve a particular goal in the context of an API definition). The workflows document `MUST` contain an [Info](#info-object) field and at least one [Procedure](#procedure-object) field. A Workflows document uses and conforms to the Workflows Specification.

## Specification

### Versions

The Workflows Specification is versioned using a `major`.`minor`.`patch` versioning scheme. The `major`.`minor` portion of the version string (for example 1.0) SHALL designate the Workflows feature set. `.patch` versions address errors in, or provide clarifications to, this document, not the feature set. The patch version SHOULD NOT be considered by tooling, making no distinction between 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 for example.

### Format

A Workflows document that conforms to the Workflows Specification is itself a JSON object, which may be represented either in JSON or YAML format.

All field names in the specification are **case sensitive**.
This includes all fields that are used as keys in a map, except where explicitly noted that keys are **case insensitive**.

In order to preserve the ability to round-trip between YAML and JSON formats, YAML version [1.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) is RECOMMENDED along with some additional constraints:

- Tags MUST be limited to those allowed by the [JSON Schema ruleset](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2803231).
- Keys used in YAML maps MUST be limited to a scalar string, as defined by the [YAML Failsafe schema ruleset](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2802346).

### Document Structure

It is RECOMMENDED that the root Workflows document be named: `workflows.yaml`.

### Data Types

Data types in the OAS are based on the types supported by the [JSON Schema Specification Draft 2020-12](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00#section-4.2.1). Note that integer as a type is also supported and is defined as a JSON number without a fraction or exponent part.

As defined by the JSON Schema Validation vocabulary, data types can have an optional modifier property: `format`. Workflows additionally supports the formats (similar to the OpenAPI specification) to provide fine detail for primitive data types.

The formats defined are:
[`type`](#dataTypes) | [`format`](#dataTypeFormat) | Comments
------ | -------- | --------
`integer` | `int32` | signed 32 bits
`integer` | `int64` | signed 64 bits (a.k.a long)
`number` | `float` | |
`number` | `double` | |
`string` | `password` | A hint to UIs to obscure input.


### Relative References in URLs

Unless specified otherwise, all properties that are URLs MAY be relative references as defined by [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.2).
Unless specified otherwise, relative references are resolved using the URL of the referring document.

### Schema

In the following description, if a field is not explicitly **REQUIRED** or described with a MUST or SHALL, it can be considered OPTIONAL.

#### Workflows Object

This is the root object of the [Workflows document](#workflowsDocument).

##### Fixed Fields

Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="workflowsVersion"></a>workflows | `string` | **REQUIRED**. This string MUST be the [version number](#versions) of the Workflows Specification that the Workflows document uses. The `workflows` field SHOULD be used by tooling to interpret the Workflows document. 
<a name="workflowsInfo"></a>info | [Info Object](#infoObject) | **REQUIRED**. Provides metadata about the Workflows. The metadata MAY be used by tooling as required.
<a name="workflowsTargetDocuments"></a>targetDocuments | [`string`] | **REQUIRED**. A list of URLs to the target documents (such as an OpenAPI document) this workflow applies to. Each `string` MUST be in the form of a URL.
<a name="workflowsProcedures"></a>procedures | Map[`string`, [Procedure Object](#procedureObject)] | **REQUIRED** A map between a friendly name and a workflow procedure. The map MUST have at least one entry.

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](#specificationExtensions).

#### Info Object

The object provides metadata about the Workflows.
The metadata MAY be used by the clients if needed.

##### Fixed Fields

Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="infoTitle"></a>title | `string` | **REQUIRED**. A human readable title of the Workflows document.
<a name="infoSummary"></a>summary | `string` | A short summary of the workflows.
<a name="infoDescription"></a>description | `string` | A description of the purpose of the Workflows document. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation.
<a name="infoVersion"></a>version | `string` | **REQUIRED**. A version identifier for indicating changes to the Workflows document (which is distinct from the [Workflows Specification version](#versions).


This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](#specificationExtensions).

##### Info Object Example
```
title: A pet purchasing workflow
summary: This workflow showcases how to purchase a pet through a sequence of API calls
description: |
    This workflow walks you through the steps of searching for, selecting, and purchasing an available pet.
version: 1.0.1
```


#### Procedure Object

Describes the steps to be taken across one or more APIs to achieve an objective. The procedure object MAY define variables needed in order to execute procedure steps, where the defined steps represent a call to an API operation or another procedure, and a set of outputs.

##### Fixed Fields

The `procedureId` value is **case-sensitive**. Tools and libraries MAY use the `procedureId` to uniquely identify a procedure, therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to follow common programming naming conventions.
<a name="procedureVariables"></a>variables | `JSON Schema` | A JSON Schema object representing the input variables used by this workflow
<a name="procedureSteps"></a>steps | [[Step Object](#step-object)] | **REQUIRED** An ordered list of steps where each step represents a call to an API operation or to another procedure

##### Fixed Fields

Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="stepDescription"></a>description | `string` | A description of the step. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation.
<a name="stepId"></a>stepId | `string` | **REQUIRED** Unique string to represent the step. The id SHOULD be unique amongst all steps described in the workflow. The stepId value is **case-sensitive**. Tools and libraries MAY use the stepId to uniquely identify a procedure step, therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to follow common programming naming conventions.
<a name="stepOperationId"></a>operationId | `string` | The name of an existing, resolvable OAS operation, as defined with a unique `operationId` which will be invoked by this workflow step. This field is mutually exclusive of the `operationRef` and `procedureId` fields respectively.
<a name="stepOperationRef"></a>operationRef | `string` | A relative or absolute URI reference to an OAS operation. This field is mutually exclusive of the `operationId` and `procedureId` fields respectively. Relative `operationRef` values MAY be used to locate an existing. See [OpenAPI relative reference resolution rules](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#relativeReferencesURI) for guidance. A complete [URI Template](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6570) can also be used.
<a name="stepProcedureId"></a>procedureId | `string` | The [procedureId](#fixed-fields-2) referencing an existing procedure within the Workflows document. The field is mutually exclusive of the `operationId` and `operationRef` fields respectively.
<a name="stepParameters"></a>parameters | Map[`string`, Any \| {expression}] | A map representing parameters to pass to an operation as specified with `operationId` or identified via `operationRef`. The key is the parameter name to be used, whereas the value can be a constant or an expression to be evaluated and passed to the referenced operation or procedure. The parameter name can be qualified using the parameter location [{in}.]{name} for operations that use the same parameter name in different locations (e.g. path.id).
<a name="dependsOn"></a>dependsOn | [`string`] | A list of steps that MUST be completed before this step can be processed. This helps to ensure workflow steps are executed in the correct order and that dependent steps are not processed in parallel. The values provided MUST be the be the `stepId` which uniquely references a step. 
<a name="stepSuccessCriteria"></a>successCriteria | [{expression}] | A list of assertions to determine the success of the step
<a name="stepOnSuccess"></a>onSuccess | [[Success Action](#success-action-object)] | An array of success action objects that specify what to do upon step success. If omitted, the next sequential step shall be executed as the default behavior.
<a name="stepOnFailure"></a>onFailure | [[Failure Action](#failure-action-object)] | An array of failure action objects that specify what to do upon step failure. If omitted, the default behavior is to break and return.
<a name="outputs"></a>outputs | Map[`string`, {expression}] |  A map between a friendly name and a dynamic output value. The name must be unique and a valid JavaScript identifier.

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](#specificationExtensions).

      - $statusCode == 200
    outputs:
        # outputs from this step
        availablePets: $response.body


```

#### Success Action Object

A single success action which describes an action to take upon success of a procedure step.

##### Fixed Fields
Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="successActionType"></a> type | string | **REQUIRED** The type of action to take. Possible values are `"end"` or `"goTo"`
<a name="successStepId"></a> stepId | string | The `stepId` to jump to based on the success of the step. This field is only relevant when the `type` field value is `goTo`. The value of the `stepId` MAY be within any procedure defined in the Workflows document. For convenience, the value MAY be formatted as _procedureId.stepId_.
<a name="successCriteria"></a> criteria | [{expression}] |  A list of assertions to determine if this action SHALL be executed.

**Note -** should multiple success actions have similar successCriteria, the first sequential action matching the criteria SHALL be the action executed.

##### Success Action Object Example
```
type: goTo
stepId: joinWaitingListStep
criteria: 
    # assertions to determine if this success action should be executed
    - $response.body.Pets.length() > 0
```

#### Failure Action Object

A single failure action which describes an action to take upon success of a procedure step.

##### Fixed Fields
Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="failureActionType"></a> type | string | **REQUIRED** The type of action to take. Possible values are `"end"`, `"goTo"` or `"retry"`
<a name="failureStepId"></a> stepId | string | The `stepId` to jump to based on the failure of the step. This field is only relevant when the `type` field value is `goTo`. The value of the `stepId` MAY be within any procedure defined in the Workflows document. For convenience, the value MAY be formatted as _procedureId.stepId_.
<a name="failureRetryAfter"></a> retryAfter | number | A non-negative decimal indicating the seconds delay after the step failure before another attempt SHALL be made. **Note:** if an HTTP [Retry-After](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-retry-after) response header was returned to a step from a targeted operation, then it SHOULD overrule this particular field value. This field only applies when the `type` field value is `retry`.
<a name="failureRetryLimit"></a> retryLimit | integer | A non-negative integer indicating how many attempts to retry the step MAY be attempted before failing the overall step. If not specified then a single retry SHALL be attempted. This field only applies when the `type` field value is `retry`. The `retryLimit` MUST be exhausted prior to executing subsequent failure actions.
<a name="failureCriteria"></a> criteria | [{expression}] |  A list of assertions to determine if this action SHALL be executed.

**Note -** should multiple success actions have similar successCriteria, the first sequential action matching the criteria SHALL be the action executed.

##### Failure Action Object Example
```
type: retry
retryAfter: 3
retryLimit: 5
criteria: 
    # assertions to determine if this action should be executed
    - $statusCode == 503
```

### <a name="specificationExtensions"></a>Specification Extensions

While the Workflows Specification tries to accommodate most use cases, additional data can be added to extend the specification at certain points.

The extension properties are implemented as patterned fields that are always prefixed by `"x-"`.

Field Pattern | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="workflowsExtensions"></a>^x- | Any | Allows extensions to the Workflows Specification. The field name MUST begin with `x-`, for example, `x-internal-id`. Field names beginning `x-oai-` and `x-oas-` are reserved for uses defined by the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/). The value MAY be `null`, a primitive, an array or an object.

The extensions may or may not be supported by the available tooling, but those may be extended as well to add requested support (if tools are internal or open-sourced).


## <a name="revisionHistory"></a>Appendix A: Revision History

Version   | Date       | Notes
---       | ---        | ---
1.0.0     | TBD        | First release of the Workflows Specification


## <a name="openQuestionsAndIdeas"></a>Appendix B: Open Questions and Ideas

1. What Expression syntax should be used (am guessing similar to OpenAPI with additions for accessing dynamic workflow params/output properties)
2. For success criteria, JSON Path or JSON Pointer and/or custom evaluation rules?
3. For parameter and request injection, should we create a new `StepMapping` object (inspired by LinkObjects in OAS but more suited to needs)?
