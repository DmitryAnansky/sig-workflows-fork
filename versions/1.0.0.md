## Introduction

Being able to express specific sequences of calls and articulate the dependencies between them to achieve a particular goal is desirable in the context of an API definition(s). The aim of the Workflows Specification, is to provide a mechanism that can define sequences of calls and their dependencies to be expressed in the context of delivering a particular outcome or set of outcomes when dealing with API definitions (such as OpenAPI documents).

The Workflows Specification can articulate these workflows in a human and machine-readable manner, thus improving the capability of API specifications to tell the story of the API in a manner that can improved the consuming developer experience.

## Definitions

##### Workflows Document
A self-contained or composite resource which defines or describes API workflows (specific sequence of calls to achieve a particular goal in the context of an API definition). The workflows document `MUST` contain a valid Workflows Specification version field (`workflowsSpec`), an [Info](#info-object) field, a `sources` field with at least one defined [Source](#source-object), and there `MUST` be at least one [Workflow](#workflow-object) defined in the workflows fixed field. A Workflows document uses and conforms to the Workflows Specification.

## Specification

### Versions

The Workflows Specification is versioned using a `major`.`minor`.`patch` versioning scheme. The `major`.`minor` portion of the version string (for example 1.0) SHALL designate the Workflows feature set. `.patch` versions address errors in, or provide clarifications to, this document, not the feature set. The patch version SHOULD NOT be considered by tooling, making no distinction between 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 for example.

### Format

A Workflows document that conforms to the Workflows Specification is itself a JSON object, which may be represented either in JSON or YAML format.

All field names in the specification are **case sensitive**.
This includes all fields that are used as keys in a map, except where explicitly noted that keys are **case insensitive**.

In order to preserve the ability to round-trip between YAML and JSON formats, YAML version [1.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) is RECOMMENDED along with some additional constraints:

- Tags MUST be limited to those allowed by the [JSON Schema ruleset](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2803231).
- Keys used in YAML maps MUST be limited to a scalar string, as defined by the [YAML Failsafe schema ruleset](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2802346).

### Document Structure

It is RECOMMENDED that the root Workflows document be named: `workflows.json` or `workflows.yaml`.

### Data Types

Data types in the Workflows Specification are based on the types supported by the [JSON Schema Specification Draft 2020-12](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00#section-4.2.1). Note that integer as a type is also supported and is defined as a JSON number without a fraction or exponent part.

As defined by the JSON Schema Validation vocabulary, data types can have an optional modifier property: `format`. Workflows additionally supports the formats (similar to the OpenAPI specification) to provide fine detail for primitive data types.

The formats defined are:
[`type`](#data-types) | `format` | Comments
------ | -------- | --------
`integer` | `int32` | signed 32 bits
`integer` | `int64` | signed 64 bits (a.k.a long)
`number` | `float` | |
`number` | `double` | |
`string` | `password` | A hint to UIs to obscure input.


### Relative References in URLs

Unless specified otherwise, all properties that are URLs MAY be relative references as defined by [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.2).
Unless specified otherwise, relative references are resolved using the URL of the referring document.

### Schema

In the following description, if a field is not explicitly **REQUIRED** or described with a MUST or SHALL, it can be considered OPTIONAL.

#### Workflows Specification Object

This is the root object of the [Workflows document](#workflows-document).

##### Fixed Fields

Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="workflowsVersion"></a>workflowsSpec | `string` | **REQUIRED**. This string MUST be the [version number](#versions) of the Workflows Specification that the Workflows document uses. The `workflowsSpec` field SHOULD be used by tooling to interpret the Workflows document.
<a name="workflowsInfo"></a>info | [Info Object](#info-object) | **REQUIRED**. Provides metadata about the Workflows. The metadata MAY be used by tooling as required.
<a name="workflowsSources"></a>sources | [[Source Object](#source-object)] | **REQUIRED**. A list of source documents (such as an OpenAPI document) this workflow SHALL apply to. The list MUST have at least one entry.
<a name="workflows"></a>workflows | [[Workflow Object](#workflow-object)] | **REQUIRED**. A list of workflows. The list MUST have at least one entry.

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](#specification-extensions).

<a name="stepOperationId"></a>operationId | `string` | The name of an existing, resolvable operation, as defined with a unique `operationId` and existing within one of the `source` documents. The referenced operation will be invoked by this workflow step. If more than one `source` document is defined within a Workflows document, then the `operationId` specified MUST be prefixed with the source name to avoid ambiguity or potential clashes. This field is mutually exclusive of the `operationRef` and `workflowId` fields respectively.
<a name="stepOperationRef"></a>operationRef | `string` | A relative or absolute URI reference to an OAS operation. This field is mutually exclusive of the `operationId` and `workflowId` fields respectively. Relative `operationRef` values MAY be used to locate an existing. See [OpenAPI relative reference resolution rules](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#relativeReferencesURI) for guidance. A complete [URI Template](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6570) can also be used.

##### Step Object Example

**Single step**

```yaml
stepId: loginStep
description: This step demonstrates the user login step
operationId: loginUser
parameters:
    # parameters to inject into the loginUser operation (parameter name must be resolvable at the referenced operation and the value is determined using {expression} syntax)

  - stepId: loginStep
    description: This step demonstrates the user login step
    operationId: loginUser
    parameters:
        # parameters to inject into the loginUser operation (parameter name must be resolvable at the referenced operation and the value is determined using {expression} syntax)

      - $statusCode == 200
    outputs:
        # outputs from this step
        availablePets: $response.body
```

#### Parameter Object

Describes a single step parameter. A unique parameter is defined by the combination of a `name` and `in` fields. There are five possible locations specified by the `in` field:
  - path - Used together with OpenAPI style [Path Templating](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#pathTemplating), where the parameter value is actually part of the operation's URL. This does not include the host or base path of the API. For example, in /items/{itemId}, the path parameter is itemId.
  - query - Parameters that are appended to the URL. For example, in `/items?id=###`, the query parameter is `id`.
  - header - Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#page-22) states header names are case insensitive.
  - cookie - Used to pass a specific cookie value to the source API.
  - body - The request, message or form body to be sent to the referenced operation.
  - workflow - Parameters to be passed into a referenced workflow

##### Fixed Fields
Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="parameterName"></a> name | string | **REQUIRED**. The name of the parameter. Parameter names are _case sensitive_.
<a name="parameterIn"></a> in | string | **REQUIRED**. The name location of the parameter. Possible values are `"path"`, `"query"`, `"header"`, `"cookie"`, `"body"`, or `"workflow"`.
<a name="parameterStyle"></a> style | string | Describes how the parameter value will be serialized depending on the location of parameter value. This fixed field is predominately used to express how a _request body_ is to be serialized. For example, when request data (`in` with value `"body"`) is to be serialized as `x-www-form-urlencoded`, the style SHOULD be `"form"`. `in` parameters with values of `"query"`, `"header"`, or "`cookie`" MUST derive their style from the referenced `source` when applicable.
<a name="parameterTarget"></a> target | {JSON Pointer} | A [JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) expression identifying locations to inject the value. Can be useful for targeting specific request body part.
<a name="parameterValue"></a> value | Any \| {expression} | **REQUIRED**. The value to pass in the parameter. The value can be a constant or an [expression](#runtime-expressions) to be evaluated and passed to the referenced operation or workflow.

##### Parameter Object Example
**Query Example**

```yaml
- name: username
  in: query
  value: $inputs.username
```

**Encoded Body Example**

```yaml
- name: client_id
  in: body
  style: form
  value: $inputs.clientId
- name: grant_type
  in: body
  style: form
  value: authorization_code
- name: redirect_uri
  in: body
  style: form
  value: $inputs.redirectUri
- name: client_secret
  in: body
  style: form
  value: $inputs.clientSecret
- name: code
  in: body
  style: form
  value: $steps.browser-authorize.outputs.code
- name: scope
  in: body
  style: form
  value: $inputs.scope
```

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](#specification-extensions).

#### Success Action Object

A single success action which describes an action to take upon success of a workflow step.

##### Fixed Fields
Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="successActionType"></a> type | string | **REQUIRED**. The type of action to take. Possible values are `"end"` or `"goto"`
<a name="successStepId"></a> stepId | string | The `stepId` to jump to based on the success of the step. This field is only relevant when the `type` field value is `goto`. The value of the `stepId` MAY be within any workflow defined in the Workflows document. For convenience, the value MAY be formatted as _workflowId.stepId_.
<a name="successCriteria"></a> criteria | [{expression}] |  A list of assertions to determine if this action SHALL be executed.

**Note -** should multiple success actions have similar `criteria`, the first sequential action matching the criteria SHALL be the action executed.

##### Success Action Object Example

```yaml
type: goto
stepId: joinWaitingListStep
criteria:
    # assertions to determine if this success action should be executed
    - $response.body.Pets.length() > 0
```

#### Failure Action Object

A single failure action which describes an action to take upon success of a workflow step.

##### Fixed Fields
Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="failureActionType"></a> type | string | **REQUIRED**. The type of action to take. Possible values are `"end"`, `"goto"` or `"retry"`
<a name="failureStepId"></a> stepId | string | The `stepId` to jump to based on the failure of the step. This field is only relevant when the `type` field value is `goto`. The value of the `stepId` MAY be within any workflow defined in the Workflows document. For convenience, the value MAY be formatted as _workflowId.stepId_.
<a name="failureRetryAfter"></a> retryAfter | number | A non-negative decimal indicating the milliseconds delay after the step failure before another attempt SHALL be made. **Note:** if an HTTP [Retry-After](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-retry-after) response header was returned to a step from a targeted operation, then it SHOULD overrule this particular field value. This field only applies when the `type` field value is `retry`.
<a name="failureRetryLimit"></a> retryLimit | integer | A non-negative integer indicating how many attempts to retry the step MAY be attempted before failing the overall step. If not specified then a single retry SHALL be attempted. This field only applies when the `type` field value is `retry`. The `retryLimit` MUST be exhausted prior to executing subsequent failure actions.
<a name="failureCriteria"></a> criteria | [{expression}] |  A list of assertions to determine if this action SHALL be executed.

**Note -** should multiple success actions have similar `criteria`, the first sequential action matching the criteria SHALL be the action executed.

##### Failure Action Object Example

```yaml
type: retry
retryAfter: 1000
retryLimit: 5
criteria:
    # assertions to determine if this action should be executed
    - $statusCode == 503
```

### <a name="runtimeExpressions"></a>Runtime Expressions
A runtime expression allows values to be defined based on information that will be available within an HTTP message, an event message, and within objects serialized from the Workflows document such as [workflows](#workflow-object) or [steps](#step-object).

The runtime expression is defined by the following [ABNF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234) syntax:

```abnf
      expression = ( "$url" / "$method" / "$statusCode" / "$request." source / "$response." source / "$message." source / "$inputs." name / "$outputs." name / "$steps." name / "$workflows." name)
      source = ( header-reference / query-reference / path-reference / body-reference / message-header-reference / message-payload-reference )
      header-reference = "header." token
      query-reference = "query." name
      path-reference = "path." name
      body-reference = "body" ["#" json-pointer ]
      message-header-reference = "header" ["#" json-pointer]
      message-payload-reference = "payload" ["#" json-pointer]
      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )

##### <a name="runtimeExpressionExamples"></a>Examples

Source Location | example expression  | notes
---|:---|:---|
HTTP Method            | `$method`         | The allowable values for the `$method` will be those for the HTTP operation.
Requested media type | `$request.header.accept`        |
Request parameter      | `$request.path.id`        | Request parameters MUST be declared in the `parameters` section of the parent operation or they cannot be evaluated. This includes request headers.
Request body property   | `$request.body#/user/uuid`   | In operations which accept payloads, references may be made to portions of the `requestBody` or the entire body.
Request URL            | `$url`            |
Response value         | `$response.body#/status`       |  In operations which return payloads, references may be made to portions of the response body or the entire body.
Response header        | `$response.header.Server` |  Single header values only are available
workflow input        | `$inputs.username` or `$workflows.foo.inputs.username` |  Single input values only are available
Step output value        | `$steps.someStep.pets` |  In situations where the output named property return payloads, references may be made to portions of the response body or the entire body.
Workflow output value | `$outputs.bar` or `$workflows.foo.outputs.bar` |  Single input values only are available

Runtime expressions preserve the type of the referenced value.
Expressions can be embedded into string values by surrounding the expression with `{}` curly braces.


### <a name="specificationExtensions"></a>Specification Extensions

While the Workflows Specification tries to accommodate most use cases, additional data can be added to extend the specification at certain points.

The extension properties are implemented as patterned fields that are always prefixed by `"x-"`.

Field Pattern | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="workflowsExtensions"></a>^x- | Any | Allows extensions to the Workflows Specification. The field name MUST begin with `x-`, for example, `x-internal-id`. Field names beginning `x-oai-` and `x-oas-` are reserved for uses defined by the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/). The value MAY be `null`, a primitive, an array or an object.

The extensions may or may not be supported by the available tooling, but those may be extended as well to add requested support (if tools are internal or open-sourced).


## <a name="revisionHistory"></a>Appendix A: Revision History

Version   | Date       | Notes
---       | ---        | ---
1.0.0     | TBD        | First release of the Workflows Specification


## <a name="openQuestionsAndIdeas"></a>Appendix B: Open Questions and Ideas

1. What Expression syntax should be used? Initial framing leverages OpenAPI expression syntax as used by Link Object and extend to cover also AsyncAPI needs as well as workflow specific needs.
2. For success criteria, JSONPath or JSON Pointer and/or custom evaluation rules (similar to GitHub action expressions)? Should we combine with runtime expressions or handle separately?


## <a name="contextualScopeImage"></a>Appendix C: Contextual scope / access for inputs and outputs

This quick image is to add some context / scope access overview for `inputs`, `step parameters`, `step outputs` and `workflow outputs`
